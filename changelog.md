I generally tried to keep up with Lighthouse reports even before this assignment so there wasn't too much to do
### Changes to Home Page index.html
- added explicit width and height to applicable images
- converted .png and .jpeg to .webp files (Serve images in next-gen formats)
- hide the answers to the Get To Know Me section so it's more interactive



### Changes to CRUD crud.html
- fixed Delete/Edit button icons, now using local file to avoid dependency issues
- fixed various styling/color for accessibility
- optimized for mobile
